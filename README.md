Markov Chains are mathematical systems that transition from one state (or word) to another based on probabilities derived from a given dataset. The project focuses on leveraging these probabilistic models to create coherent and contextually relevant text.

Key Objectives:

Model Overview: Understand the principles of Markov Chains, including state transition matrices and how they model probabilistic word sequences.
Text Generation: Develop a text generation system using Markov Chains to produce new content based on the statistical patterns observed in a source text corpus.
Evaluation: Analyze the quality and coherence of the generated text and assess how well it captures the style and structure of the original data.
